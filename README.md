## CardBoulevard --- A domain-specific programming language
CardBoulevard is a programming language intended to make creating card games like poker, blackjack, and games with custom rules and logic, easier for the user and programmer. This current version of CardBoulevard can generate a playable game for users following a variety of constraints. This language takes away the complexities of card and player object management, allowing developers to prototype, test, and run card-based games efficiently. The goal of CardBoulevard is to provide a declarative, human-readable way to manage and define cards and decks, rules, game state changes, and win conditions.
By taking in a user-written file, CardBoulevard interprets the code and generates a playable game that responds to user input as determined by the original code. such as user choices and custom conditional logic. CardBoulevard’s current version can handle a variety of game logic, from simple one-turn games to more complicated games with multiple players, turns, and custom win conditions. It’s structure is designed to be easily readable and accessible, even to users with limited programming experience.
